Nonviolence is the greatest force at our disposal.Truth and love are the pillars of a peaceful society.Satyagraha is the pursuit of truth through nonviolent means.The path of forgiveness leads to inner peace and freedom.Service to humanity is the essence of a meaningful life.
Simple living and high thinking bring contentment and fulfillment.Education is the key to unlocking a brighter future for all.The strength of a nation lies in the well-being of its weakest members.Be the change you wish to see in the world, one act of kindness at a time.Harmony among religions and cultures paves the way for unity and progress.
